# Working with Articles in Category 2

This document demonstrates how to create **article-style content** for Category 2 of your digital library. Articles are typically shorter than books but longer than simple guides.

## Article Structure

Articles in your digital library should follow a consistent structure:

### 1. Clear Introduction
Start with a compelling introduction that explains what the reader will learn.

### 2. Main Content Sections
Break your content into logical sections with descriptive headings.

### 3. Practical Examples
Include real-world examples that illustrate your points.

### 4. Conclusion and Next Steps
End with a summary and suggested follow-up actions.

## Content Categories

Category 2 is perfect for:

- **Research Articles**: Academic or professional research
- **Opinion Pieces**: Thought leadership and commentary  
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples and analysis
- **Technical Articles**: In-depth technical explanations

## Writing Tips for Articles

### Keep It Focused
Articles should have a single, clear focus. Don't try to cover too many topics in one piece.

### Use Subheadings
Break up your content with descriptive subheadings to improve readability:

- Makes content scannable
- Helps readers find specific information
- Improves SEO and discoverability

### Include Visual Elements

When appropriate, include:

```markdown
- Code blocks for technical content
- Lists for easy scanning
- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italics* for definitions or foreign terms
```

## Example: Technical Implementation

Here's how you might document a technical process:

```javascript
// Example code for your articles
function processContent(markdown) {
    return {
        pdf: mdtexpdf(markdown),
        audio: mdaudiobook(markdown),
        epub: mdepub(markdown)
    };
}
```

## Metadata Best Practices

Your article frontmatter should include:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Author**: Your name or organization
- **Date**: Publication or last update date
- **Type**: "article" for this category
- **Category**: "category2" for proper organization
- **Slug**: URL-friendly identifier
- **Summary**: Brief description for listings
- **Tags**: Relevant keywords for discovery

## Integration with the Library

Once you've written your article:

1. **Save** it in the appropriate category folder
2. **Build** using `make build-content` to generate all formats
3. **Preview** with `make dev` to see it in your library
4. **Deploy** when you're ready to publish

## Linking Between Content

You can link to other content in your library:

- Reference other articles in the same category
- Link to related books or guides
- Create content series that build on each other

## Conclusion

Articles are a great way to share focused, actionable content with your audience. They're easier to write than full books but more substantial than simple guides.

**Remember**: The goal is to provide value to your readers while demonstrating the power of the Universalis ecosystem for content creation and distribution.
